# Airbnb Database Normalization Review (Up to 3NF)

As the software engineer responsible for reviewing and refining the Airbnb database schema, I conducted a normalization analysis to ensure the design adheres to the principles of **Third Normal Form (3NF)**. The goal was to identify any redundancies or transitive dependencies and to optimize the data structure for scalability and integrity.

---

## Ì∑© Schema Overview

The original schema consisted of the following entities:

- **User** (`user_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `phone_number`, `role`, `created_at`)
- **Property** (`property_id`, `host_id`, `name`, `description`, `location`, `pricepernight`, `created_at`, `updated_at`)
- **Booking** (`booking_id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`, `status`, `created_at`)
- **Payment** (`payment_id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `payment_method`)
- **Review** (`review_id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`)
- **Message** (`message_id`, `sender_id`, `recipient_id`, `message_body`, `sent_at`)

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)

I confirmed that each entity:
- Contains only atomic values
- Has uniquely named columns
- Has a defined primary key

The schema meets the requirements for 1NF with no repeating groups or multivalued attributes.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)

Since all the tables use **single-column primary keys**, I verified that:
- All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the whole primary key.

There were no partial dependencies. The schema satisfies 2NF.

---

## Ì¥ç Step 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)

Here I examined the tables for **transitive dependencies** and **potential redundancies**.

### 1. `User.role` (ENUM)
- Each role is tied directly to the user and has no additional attributes.
- ‚úÖ No need to extract this into a separate table unless role-based permissions evolve.

### 2. `Property.location`
- The `location` field could be normalized into a separate `Location` table, especially if properties in the same city or region are common.
- Ì≥å *Normalization suggestion*:

```sql
Location(location_id, city, state, country)
Property(location_id FK)
````

This improves maintainability and supports location-based queries.

### 3. `Payment.payment_method` (ENUM)

* This ENUM works fine for a small, fixed set (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
* However, for extensibility, I could replace it with a `PaymentMethod` table:

```sql
PaymentMethod(method_id, method_name)
Payment(method_id FK)
```

Useful if we expect to integrate with more gateways in the future.

### 4. `Booking.total_price`

* This value can be **derived** from `pricepernight √ó number of nights`.
* If it's only used for display, I recommend calculating this on the fly.
* If needed for auditing or historical pricing, keeping it makes sense.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional Notes

* The `Message` table references both `sender_id` and `recipient_id` from the `User` table. This is a valid self-referencing relationship and does not violate normalization.
* All primary and foreign keys are correctly indexed.

---

## Ì∑† Conclusion

The Airbnb schema is **well-structured and mostly conforms to 3NF**. The few areas I highlighted (like `location` and `payment_method`) depend on whether flexibility and scalability are needed in those domains.

The revised design improves data integrity, reduces redundancy, and prepares the system for future growth.
