#### Ì∑© Partitioning Strategy

We implemented **range partitioning** on the `bookings` table using the `start_date` column. The data was divided into multiple yearly partitions (`bookings_2022`, `bookings_2023`, and `bookings_2024`), which helps optimize queries that filter by date.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Observations

Before partitioning:

* Queries scanning date ranges across the entire table took longer to execute.
* The query plan indicated a **sequential scan** over the full `bookings` table, even for narrow date filters.

After partitioning:

* The same query only scanned the **relevant partition**, significantly reducing the amount of data processed.
* `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` showed reduced execution time and a **more efficient query plan**.
* Indexes created on each partition further boosted performance for `start_date` lookups.

#### Ì∑† Conclusion

Partitioning the `bookings` table by `start_date` dramatically improved query performance for date-based filters. This approach is ideal for large, time-series-like datasets and is an essential optimization technique for scalable applications.
