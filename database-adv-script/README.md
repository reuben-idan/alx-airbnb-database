# ALX Airbnb Database Module Project

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program, focused on advanced database design, querying, and optimization. It simulates the backend of an Airbnb-like platform, providing a real-world environment to apply SQL skills in managing users, bookings, properties, and reviews.

## Objectives

- Master complex SQL queries using joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions.
- Optimize database performance through indexing and query refactoring.
- Implement partitioning strategies for handling large datasets.
- Monitor and analyze database performance using EXPLAIN and ANALYZE.
- Think critically about schema design and performance trade-offs in high-scale applications.

## Key Features

- **Entity-Relationship Modeling**: Define relationships between users, properties, bookings, and reviews.
- **Advanced Joins**: Use INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN for meaningful data insights.
- **Subqueries and Aggregations**: Analyze platform data such as user activity and booking trends.
- **Indexing**: Improve query speed for large datasets by indexing key columns.
- **Partitioning**: Break down large tables for efficient range-based queries.
- **Performance Tuning**: Monitor and refine query execution for scalability.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Use the SQL scripts to set up and populate the database.
3. Run provided queries and optimization tasks using your preferred SQL environment.
4. Analyze performance using `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`.
5. Submit insights and query results through your GitHub repo.

## Requirements

- Basic SQL and database design knowledge
- PostgreSQL or MySQL installed locally
- Git for version control
